Where Sphinx meets Sphincter - The Bottom Line in Riddles

[![Screenshot](img/index_screenshot.png)](https://lwalker.me/sphinxster/index.html)

Ever thought the ancient Sphinx's riddles needed more posterior humor? Neither did we, until now! 

Sphinx-ster is what happens when you combine riddles with rear-end jokes - a truly cheeky experiment that proves even AI can have a sense of humor that falls flat. This project emerged from a conversation where a friend's impressive posterior knowledge made them the butt of too many jokes.

**WARNING**: This app contains rear-end humor that might cause you to:
- Snicker inappropriately
- Question your life choices
- Learn more about gluteal anatomy than you ever wanted to

## Features

- 50+ posterior-themed riddles that will test your derri√®re deduction skills
- Score tracking to show off your bottom-line brilliance
- Hint system for when you're feeling behind
- Shuffle feature to keep your cheeks guessing

## Disclaimer

This project is not intended to be taken seriously. It was part of an AI code generation experiment and is meant purely for light posterior amusement. If you're offended by butt jokes, this probably isn't for you. If you're not offended by butt jokes, you should probably still question your life choices.
